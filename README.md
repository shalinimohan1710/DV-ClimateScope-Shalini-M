# ClimateScope: Visualizing Global Weather Trends and Extreme Events

## Project Objective
The objective of ClimateScope is to analyze and visually represent global weather patterns using the Global Weather Repository dataset. This project aims to uncover seasonal trends, regional variations, and extreme weather events through interactive and insightful visualizations. By leveraging daily-updated, worldwide weather data, the project will enable users to explore climate behavior over time, compare conditions across regions, and identify anomalies. The ultimate goal is to provide an accessible, data-driven platform that supports climate awareness, decision-making, and further research into global weather dynamics.

## Project Workflow

### Data Acquisition
- Download the Global Weather Repository dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository/data).
- Ensure daily updates are synchronized if using the live version.

### Data Understanding & Exploration
- Inspect dataset structure, data types, and key variables (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, etc.).
- Identify missing values, anomalies, and coverage across regions.

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handle missing or inconsistent entries.
- Convert units (if necessary) and normalize values.
- Aggregate or filter data (e.g., daily → monthly averages) for efficiency.

### Data Analysis
- Perform statistical analysis to understand distributions and correlations.
- Identify seasonal patterns, trends, and extreme weather events.
- Compare weather conditions across countries, continents, or climate zones.

### Data Visualization Design
- Select suitable visualization types:
  - Choropleth maps for geographic patterns  
  - Line charts for time-series trends  
  - Scatterplots for correlations  
  - Heatmaps for seasonal variation  
- Design an interactive dashboard layout.

### Visualization Development
- Build static and interactive visualizations using tools like Plotly, Tableau, Power BI, or D3.js.
- Integrate filters, sliders, and region selectors for user interactivity.

### Insights Generation
- Highlight notable findings such as temperature anomalies, high-precipitation zones, or wind speed extremes.
- Summarize regional and global climate trends.

### Final Dashboard & Reporting
- Deploy the dashboard as a web app or presentation.
- Document methodology, visualizations, and insights in a project report.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Incorporate live API-based weather updates.
- Add predictive modeling for weather forecasting.
- Enable anomaly alerts for extreme events.
